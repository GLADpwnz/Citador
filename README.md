###Plugin installation

####Getting the files
In order to install, follow the steps of a regular plugin installation:

4. Place the downloaded file there.

####Getting token
After installing, the last thing you need to do before restarting is defining your token.
To get your token, follow these steps:

1. Type `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` on your Discord and click in Applications, on the top (if it doesn't show up click on the arrow >>)
2. Click in `Local Storage` and look for "token"on the list.

####Installing token
Click in Local Storage and look for "token"on the list.

1. Open the file `Citador.plugin.js` (with Notepad++ preferably) and put the token where it says `"PUT YOUR TOKEN HERE"` (put the token with quotation marks, please ~~if you haven't copied with the quotation marks already~~)
2. Save and reload Discord with `Ctrl` + `R`
3. Done, now you have the plugin installed and working.
